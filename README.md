📈 Finance Prediction System — 2025

AI-based stock and financial market forecasting to analyze trends and predict future price movements with improved accuracy.

🎯 Project Overview

Finance Prediction Platform that combines:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and technical indicators.

Machine Learning Models: Regression, LSTMs, and ensemble methods for trend prediction.

Visualization Dashboard: Charts for stock trends and model performance.

Deployment Ready: Scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction.


🛠️ Technology Stack

Backend & ML: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Deployment (Optional): FastAPI / Streamlit

🚀 Quick Start
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/shakti-siva/Finance-prediction.git
cd Finance-prediction

Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Training
python train.py

Run Prediction
python predict_stock.py

🎮 System Components

Data Preprocessing

Location: src/data/

Features: Cleans raw datasets, computes moving averages, RSI, MACD

Run: python src/data/preprocess.py

Model Training

Location: src/models/

Features: ML/DL models for trend forecasting

Run: python src/models/train_model.py

Prediction Engine

Location: src/predict/

Features: Uses saved models to predict next-day stock movements

Run: python predict_stock.py

Visualization Dashboard (Optional)

Location: src/dashboard/

Features: Interactive charts, accuracy monitoring

Run: streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py

📊 Example Results

Accuracy: ~60–65% (varies by dataset & model)

Improved Forecasting: Uses technical indicators + sentiment (optional)

Visualization: Stock trend comparison with predictions

🔧 Configuration

Create a .env file (optional) to store settings:

DATA_PATH=data/final_dataset.csv
MODEL_PATH=models/saved_model.h5
PREDICTION_OUTPUT=outputs/predictions.csv

🧪 Testing
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/

# Run prediction test
python predict_stock.py --test

📈 Expected Outcomes

Better-than-random stock predictions (~60–65% accuracy)

Automated data processing & model retraining pipeline

Visual reports for stock price trends and model evaluation

🐛 Troubleshooting

Dataset Not Found: Ensure CSV is in data/ directory.

Dependencies Missing: Run pip install -r requirements.txt.

Flat Predictions: Check if all required features (RSI, MA, Volatility) are available.

🚀 Deployment (Optional)

Streamlit App for interactive predictions

FastAPI Service for API-based predictions

Docker Support (can be added)
